            <h1>Bleed in Elden Ring</h1>
            <p class="post-info">Posted on 6/21/2024 at 1:48pm by RETARD ADMIN</p>
            <p> Some people believe bleed to be an overpowered status effect but I don't really see it. I've always loved bleed as a mechanic and I've always felt that it's perfectly balanced alongside the others. </p>
            <p> I guess some people just don't know any better. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Yours truly, </p>

            <p> It's time. Ask me about it.</p>

            <h1>Nike Air Max 90</h1>
            <p class="post-info">Posted on 6/13/2024 at 10:30pm by RETARD ADMIN</p>
            <p> Recently I ordered a pair of Air Max 90 shoes and today they arrived at the store. All that's left to do now is to pick them up.
                I've got 7 days to do so, so more than likely it won't be done for a while.

            <p> Today I finished the basic layout of my website. </p>
            <p> It will never be finished but stay a work-in-progress (clueless) until I stop paying for the server. </p>
